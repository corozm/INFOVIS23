Guidelines for Using Generative AI1
I allow and encourage my students to use generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to boost
their productivity. However, it is crucial to be transparent about their use. If you use
generative AI tools, you must include the following information in your deliverables for the
assignments and projects:

In your appendix, include information on the generative AI tool used (e.g.,
ChatGPT with GPT 3.5) and the types of tasks it was used for. You need to report
all the tasks that you did with the generative AI. Refer to the appendix of this
document as an example. Below are some possible scenarios (but are not limited):
○ Proofreading and copy-editing to improve writing clarity.
○ Asking or searching for some information (i.e., using generative AI as an
information retrieval tool or search engine).
○ Brainstorming research ideas.

- In your appendix, write a reflection section or paragraph explaining why you used
the generative AI tools.

- If the generative AI tool created text from scratch, enclose the text in quotes and
reference it to the generative AI tool in the Bibliography or as a footnote,
including the date and prompts used to generate the text.

- If you used generative AI tools to modify content you created, such as copy-editing or
proofreading, include a comprehensive table in your appendix linking each piece
of text that was (partially) created by the generative AI tool to the exact prompts
used for that text. You can use a footnote to indicate which parts were created using
the generative AI tool.

- If you used generative AI tools to create or edit graphs/figures (for example, via
creating programming codes), reference the tool in the figure caption, including the
date and prompts used to create the figure/graph.

- If you use a series of prompts when using the generative AI, report the entire
human-AI collaboration pipeline that includes all the prompts.
Grammarly currently does not count as generative AI. So you do not need to report the
usage of Grammarly to correct grammar errors or copy-editing.
